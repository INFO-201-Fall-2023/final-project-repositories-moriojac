Pitch

In today's NBA, we see a lot more players getting injured. Unfortunately, that's just the nature of the sport. The sport has evolved to such a high pace, quick movement, high flying, and physical game. Because of the nature of the game, it demands so much on the bodies of NBA players. And ultimately because of that, NBA players are prone to injury each and every time they step on the court. But the thing is NBA players come in all shapes and sizes. What I mean by that is that all NBA players have different roles and characteristics. For example, some players play more minutes than others. Or some players are older than others. Or some players are shorter than others. Basically, there are endless categories we can place/sperate NBA players in. So for our study, we want to see if we can identify or find any factors within the stats/information of NBA players that correlate to the amount and type of injuries in the NBA.

The strong, central, unifying theme is trying to have a better understanding of the factors that can correlate to injury proneness in the NBA. By having a better understanding of these factors, NBA players and sports trainers can take the necessary steps to develop important, effective, and beneficial treatment strategies to ultimately help prevent injuries. In short, by gathering data about the factors that correlate to injury proneness in the NBA, it can ultimately help prevent injuries in the NBA.
